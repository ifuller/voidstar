Hi! My name is Ivan. I was named after prominent computer scientist Ivan Sutherland. He's an accomplished, interesting, and engaging guy. Deep down, though, I feel my first name could have been Scott. Family and friends call me Scott. Conveniently, Scott is my middle name.

I named this site voidstar.org because I was a C++ programmer. Since the 1990's. Back then I liked the idea of void* as "a pointer to anything". I rarely ever used them though. This is a ".org" domain because (in the 90's) my registrar wouldn't allow ".com" -- I was an individual, not a company, they said.

Here's a little more about me:
* I recently retired after 30 years writing software and managing teams ➡️[[Resume]](https://voidstar.org/resume/) 
* Worked at Apple, Google, Meta, various startups and medium-size companies
* Located in Mountain View, CA
* Apple fan. Current fixation: living on iPad only ➡️[[Now Page]](https://voidstar.org/now/)
* Married to my wonderful wife. We have two teen kids, one in college one nearly there
* I'm a fan of hard sci-fi and generally sci-fi that leans toward optimistic futures

# Where to find me
With near zero posts, I'm solidly a lurker/consumer of content rather than a poster/creator, but I'm here: 
* ✅ [@ifuller@micro.blog](http://micro.blog/ifuller)
* ✅ [@isfuller@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@isfuller)
* ✅ LinkedIn - but maybe just go here instead ➡️[[Resume]](https://voidstar.org/resume/) 

# Where you won't find me
* ❌ I'm not on X
* ❌ I'm not on Facebook or Instagram
* ❌ I'm not on Bluesky or Threads
* ...and many more

If you see an account that looks like me on those site, it's not me!
