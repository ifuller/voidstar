With over 30 years in software engineering, I have a strong background in both hands-on development and team management. I aim to cultivate strong, motivated teams and deliver exceptional software on schedule. Over my 15 years of managing teams, I've refined my people management skills in a variety of corporate settings, leading development teams of up to 33 individuals and overseeing managers.
