* Retired. Open to part-time engagement on software projects.
* Living on ipad. Very low desktop usage. Aiming for zero desktop.
* Creating this voidstar.org site. Slowly.
* Honing my personal productivity system. Currently enjoying Apple native apps (Notes, Reminders, Calendar). Recently I moved everything there from Google Workspace which was also good.
* One kid in college, the other will be there soon. The nest is already feeling a bit more empty. It’s bittersweet, but we’re looking forward to our next phase of the family.
* Pampering our standard poodle.
* Jogging 3x week, functional fitness 5x week.
